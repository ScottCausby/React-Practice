Var creates a variable in JavaScript, but some variables never really change and are constants.
With ES6 Let and Const were introduced, var still works but let and const are highly recommended.
Let is the new var. You use let when you want to create a variable that really is variable.
Const is used when you want to create a value that wont change or recieve a new value.

Var example

var myName = 'Scott';
console.log(myName);

console will return "Scott"

myName = 'Chris';
console.log(myName);

console will return "Chris"

because the var variable can be changed.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

Let example 

let myName = 'Scott';
console.log(myName);

console will return "Scott"

myName = 'Chris';
console.log(myName);

console will return "Chris"

because the let variable can be changed.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////

Const example

const myName = 'Scott';
console.log(myName);

console will return "Scott"

myName = 'Chris';
console.log(myName);

console will return an error

because the const variable can not be reasigned or changed
